This Fork contains :

1.Block reward reduction (i.e The currect block reward will be divided by 3). Emmission factor is changed to 20.


2.Difficulty Target has been changed to 90 sseconds. For faster block transactions.

3.Difficulty Algorithm has beeb changed to LWMA-V2. Thanks to Zawy. Thanks to TRTL devs for their small tweaks.

4.Timestamp attacks are now ineffective. Thanks to Jagerman.

5.Difficulty Algorithm is now more sensitive in 50x attacks. Thanks to fireice.

6.Building TEST is disabled.

This commit contains all the changes in one place. If you want to see the above changes in individual commits, refer https://github.com/samvicky26/worktipscoin1/tree/dev3



About the Block reward reduction:

At the time of writing this the block reward was 496992.2409 WTIP.The block reward will be calculated using this formula(https://github.com/samvicky26/worktipscoin1/blob/dc8d17bc8356d609e503ffbfaeda2155f6ef1a3f/src/CryptoNoteCore/Currency.cpp#L179).
That will be baseReward = (Total Supply - Mined Coins)/ 2^(emmision factor).
After the fork , the reward will be calculated by using 20 as emmision factor && 22 as emmision smoothing factor.A smoothing factor has been added to stop the drastic base reward drop.
The smoothing factor calculates the final base reward using this formula .
Final Base reward =((Total Supply - Mined Coins)/ 2^(emmision factor))+((Total Supply - Mined Coins)/ 2^(emmision smoothing factor)).

After doing the math, the base reward will be 155299.4409651349.
